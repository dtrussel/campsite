# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This repo tracks issues as local markdown, so a "label" is the value of the `Status:` line near the top of a spec or ticket file in `.scratch/`.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), set the file's `Status:` line to the corresponding string from this table.

Beyond triage, a ticket's `Status:` moves to `claimed` while someone works on it and `done` when it is finished.
